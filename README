The purpose of this package is to provide tools that are shared between
all kits in the database test projects.

These scripts currently depend on R and Python.

R
_

These were developed using R v2.9.2.  Older versions of R, such as
v2.6.2 do not support some of the taa and gaa parameters.  Although I
did not check when they were introduced.

Python
______

Some of the scripts make use of math.fsum, which seems like the right
thing to do because it's supposed to handle floating points more
accurate.  Did not verify at what version that was introduced, but it is
in 2.6.4.
